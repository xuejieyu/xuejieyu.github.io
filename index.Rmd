__Hello, I'm Jacky.  Welcome to  my website.  Hereâ€™s what you should know about me:.__
 
__I have been working as a statistical programmer in the pharmaceutical  industry (yeap, making drugs and saving lives), which gained me profound knowledge of statistics and proficient programing skills. I'm passionate about exploring data and solve the real world issues with the data science skills. Love to explain technical issues to non-tech audience. I'm also enthusiastic about public speaking and won a tall tale speech contest. (Data is not exactly tall tale but storytelling is an important skill for data scientist!)
 
__Our (yeap, teamwork!) recent project on Kaggle competition has won a bronze medal (top 8% ). I'm pretty proud of it. 
 
__I love to read , write stories, dance, and play ukulele sometimes.
